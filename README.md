# Employee-Management-System
This project’s main aim is to make a system that manages employees in the company. This system can also be made using files but considering it as an advanced project we will use MySQL. This project is created using console-based programming, and the system’s back-end is connected to a MySQL database.

# Packages Required
1.) MySQL client \
2.) mysql-connector-python\
3.) pymysql

After you install a MySQL package, you are ready to work with actual databases.

In order to develop an Employee Management System in Python that uses MySQL database, we must connect Python to MySQL.
